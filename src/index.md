Solving Automating GIS-processes 2021 exercises but with Rust.

Just to make things more interesting, I want to use the [GeoArrow in memory format](https://github.com/geoarrow/geoarrow/blob/main/format.md) and I want to use the [Newtype Pattern](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch19-03-advanced-traits.html#using-the-newtype-pattern-to-implement-external-traits-on-external-types) to do it.
